Since Go supports multiple languages for proto buffer code generation, the idea is to set up a generalised way to import generated code into different repositories.

Ideally, one single project can have a common folder with all the proto files, generated code, frontend, backend. But this makes the repository:
- Bulky with a lot of code
- Hard to handle when working with multiple developers.

So, the idea is to have a common repository with just the proto buffer files and the generated code. This repository should be imported into other projects that depends this project.
